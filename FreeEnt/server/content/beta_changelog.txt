Updating Initial and/or Level-Learned spells

· Add a new file in the /FreeEnt/scripts folder that has the list of either the new initial spells, the new learned spells, or both. If you leave out either initial or learned, that part of the spell list will be unchanged from vanilla.
  · Look at /f4c/dump.spellsets.f4c for the different spellsets you can use
· In /FreeEnt/generator.py you'll need to somewhere include an instruction to add your new .f4c file to the patching process. In this case, I've made the changes apply so long as Jspells aren't on. You could also put in the work to add a new flag, but you'd still  probably not want to mingle this type of change with Jspells, so an `elif(your_condition):` instead of the `else` used here is the way to go.

These changes don't attempt to touch non-vanilla Fu, nor the spells that Tellah learns via Ordeals
