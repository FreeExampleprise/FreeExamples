Updating FuSoYa's Learned Spells
· The work here is in /FreeEnt/fusoya_rando.py
· For this example, the change is to just flat out remove Nuke and Weak from the list.
· Some other things you could do:
  · Change the ordering of ALL_SPELLS_BY_GOODNESS to alter the starting position for learning a spell
  · Change the math used to alter the final positioning of each learned spell
